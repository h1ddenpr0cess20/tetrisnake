# Tetrisnake

Tetrisnake is a blend of Tetris and Snake mechanics, created as a sarcastic response to Elon Musk's AI game mashup ideas. The game was initially developed as a Pygame application with assistance from ChatGPT o3-mini-high and Grok 3. It was later converted to a web application and refined using the same AI tools. Final polishing was done using various LLMs in Cursor, primarily with claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking.

## Description

Tetrisnake combines elements from both classic games:
- Control a snake as it descends through a grid (like Tetris blocks)
- Eat food to grow the snake (like in Snake)
- When the snake collides with the bottom or other blocks, it gets locked in place
- Clear lines by filling them completely (like in Tetris)
- Avoid walls, existing blocks, and the snake's own body!

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Desktop**: Use arrow keys to move the snake left, right, up or down (holding any arrow key accelerates movement)

- **P**: Pause the game
- **Q**: When paused, quit to main menu

### Mobile Features
