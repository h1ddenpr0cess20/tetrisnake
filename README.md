# Tetrisnake

Tetrisnake is a blend of Tetris and Snake mechanics, created as a sarcastic response to Elon Musk's AI game mashup ideas. The game was initially developed as a Pygame application with assistance from ChatGPT o3-mini-high and Grok 3. It was later converted to a web application and refined using the same AI tools. Final polishing was done using various LLMs in Cursor, primarily with claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking.

## Description

Tetrisnake combines elements from both classic games:
- Control a snake as it descends through a grid (like Tetris blocks)
- Eat food to grow the snake (like in Snake)
- When the snake collides with the bottom or other blocks, it gets locked in place
- Clear lines by filling them completely (like in Tetris)
- Avoid walls, existing blocks, and the snake's own body!

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake left, right, up or down (holding any arrow key accelerates movement)
- **P**: Pause the game
- **Q**: When paused, quit to main menu

### Gameplay
1. The snake descends automatically like a Tetris piece
2. Move the snake to collect food and avoid obstacles
3. Each food item eaten increases your score and makes the snake longer
4. When the snake collides with the bottom or other blocks, it becomes locked in place
5. Fill a complete horizontal line to clear it and earn points
6. The game ends when the snake can no longer move or spawns into an occupied space
